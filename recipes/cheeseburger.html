    <h2>
      Hamburger expert George Motz shares his recipe for a Smashed Burger. A
      simple, no frills, delight.
    </h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2-lbs. Freshly-ground chuck</li>
      <li>8 White squishy buns (Arnold, Wonder, Martin's, etc.)</li>
      <li>1 Vidalia onion, sliced paper-thin on a mandolin (onion slicer)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. If the
        pan looks dry, add a tiny bit of canola or vegetable oil to lubricate
        and heat for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place your ground beef in a large mixing bowl. Do not add anything to
        the meat (that would be meatloaf).
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a salad or ice cream scooper (not your hands) grab a wad of beef a
        little larger than a golf ball and drop into the hot pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle liberally with salt then press flat with a very sturdy spatula
        with no holes. It is important that you press only once, into the shape
        of a patty, then leave it alone. Any more pressing will send precious
        juices out into the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for approximately 1-minute and a half per side and you are done. It
        is that simple.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I like to saut√© Vidalia onions to put on top and that's about it.
      Sometimes I also smash raw, thin-sliced onion in the patty at the
      beginning, a favorite of any burger joint in El Reno, OK.
